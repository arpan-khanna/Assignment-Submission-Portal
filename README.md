# Features
The assignment submission portal has the following features:

1. User Authentication: The portal requires students to log in using their university or college credentials to access the portal. This ensures that only registered students can submit assignments.
2. Assignment Creation: Faculty members can create assignments and upload relevant documents or files, including assignment instructions, rubrics, and examples.
3. Submission Form: Students can submit their assignments through a submission form provided on the portal. This form has fields for students to enter their name, student ID, course name, assignment title, and the file they want to submit.
4. Submission Deadline: The portal has a feature for setting a submission deadline for each assignment. This allows students to submit their assignments before the deadline and prevents them from submitting assignments after the deadline.
5. Grading and Feedback: After the submission deadline has passed, faculty members can access submitted assignments, grade them, and provide feedback to students. Students can also view their grades and feedback on the portal.

# Submission

The aim of this project is to create an assignment submission portal for
a particular course. The details of the project are given below:

1. User Authentication: The portal should require students to log in using
their university or college credentials to access the portal. This ensures
that only registered students can submit assignments.

2. Assignment Creation: Faculty members should be able to create
assignments and upload relevant documents or files, including assignment
instructions, rubrics, and examples.

3. Submission Form: Students should be able to submit their assignments
through a submission form provided on the portal. This form should have
fields for students to enter their name, student ID, course name,
assignment title, and the file they want to submit.

4. Submission Deadline: The portal should have a feature for setting a
submission deadline for each assignment. This will allow students to
submit their assignments before the deadline and prevent them from
submitting assignments after the deadline.

5. Grading and Feedback: After the submission deadline has passed,
faculty members should be able to access submitted assignments, grade
them, and provide feedback to students. Students should also be able to
view their grades and feedback on the portal.

6. Notifications: The portal should have a notification feature that alerts
students and faculty members of upcoming assignment deadlines, grades,
and feedback.
